Using custodian in accordance with infrastructure as code principles,
we store policy assets in a versioned control repository. This
provides for an audit log and facilitates code reviews. However this
capability is primarily of use to humans making semantic interpretations
of changes.

This script also provides logical custodian policy changes over a git
repo and allows streaming those changes for machine readable/application
consumption. Its typically used as a basis for CI integrations or indexes
over policies.

Two example use cases:

  - Doing dryrun only on changed policies within a pull request
  - Constructing a database of policy changes.

Policystream works on individual github repositories, or per Github integration
across an organization's set of repositories.

## Install

policystream can be installed via pypi, provided the require pre-requisites
libraries are available (libgit2 > 0.26)

```
pip install c7n-policystream
```

Docker images available soon, see build for constructing your own.

## Build

Alternatively a docker image can be built as follows

```shell
# Note must be top level directory of checkout
cd cloud-custodian

docker build -t policystream:latest -f tools/c7n_policystream/Dockerfile .

docker run --mount src="$(pwd)",target=/repos,type=bind policystream:latest
```

## Usage

Streaming use case (default stream is to stdout, also supports kinesis, rdbms and sqs)

```
  $ c7n-policystream stream -r foo

```

Policy diff between two source and target revision specs. If source
and target are not specified default revision selection is dependent
on current working tree branch. The intent is for two use cases, if on
a non-master branch then show the diff to master.  If on master show
the diff to previous commit on master. For repositories not using the
`master` convention, please specify explicit source and target.


```
  $ c7n-policystream diff -r foo -v
```

Pull request use, output policies changes between current branch and master.

```
  $ c7n-policystream diff -r foo
  policies:
  - filters:
    - {type: cross-account}
    name: lambda-access-check
    resource: aws.lambda
```
