A collection of tools to provide for infrastructure and operations
monitoring within AWS.

The goal is to provide a higher degree of visibility into both network and application
monitoring with correlation both on a real-time basis or on a historical basis, and
also to provide for an application centric view of infrastructure.

# Tools

- `zero-metrics` - collection of application or account metrics from cloud watch.
- `zero-flow` - flow log analysis and enrichment
- `zero-ipdb` - historical ip database and lightweight cmdb
