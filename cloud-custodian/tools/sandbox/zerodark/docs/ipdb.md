# Historical Ip Mapping

We generate a historical mapping of ip to aws resource identifiers and
then a historical record of resources to map to application logical
entities.

To optimize for lookup speed we typically generate date segmented
files that can be utilized as a local cache when performing flow log
analysis (ie last 120 days of ip changes).
