Block New Resources In Non-Standard Regions
=====================================================

The following are examples of Cloud Custodian policies which detect the region
a resource is being launched in and deletes the resource if it's outside your standard
approved regions.  These examples block the full creation of the resources launched outside
of the us-east-1 and eu-west-1 regions and then emails the event-owner
(the person launching the resource) and the Cloud Team.  This set of policies covers several
of the common AWS services but you may add your desired services if supported by Cloud Custodian.
While a proactive approach through IAM or AWS Organizations policies is the ideal way to go, that
isn't always possible or manageable for all users.  These policies take a reactive approach and may
be a fitting use case for some users.
For the notify action to work you will need to have installed and configured the Cloud Custodian
c7n-mailer tool.
