RDS - Delete Unused Databases With No Connections
=================================================

The following example policy workflow uses the mark-for-op and marked-for-op filters and
actions to chain together a set of policies to accomplish a task.  In this example it
will find any RDS that is older than 14 days that has had no connections to it in the last
14 days and tag it with a delete op and date 14 days out. The policy workflow will also
email the RDS resource owner to inform them of the upcoming stopping and deletion if the
RDS remains unused. If a customer connects to the RDS before the 14 day window it will
get unmarked so it doesn't get deleted.

Note the use of the notify action requires the Cloud Custodian mailer to be installed
and configured.
