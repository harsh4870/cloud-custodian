EBS - Create and Manage Snapshots
=================================

The following example policy will snapshot all EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances and
copy the instances tags to the snapshot. Then when the snapshots are 7 days old they will
get deleted so you always have a rolling 7 days worth of snapshots.

   policies:
     - name: ec2-create-ebs-snapshots
