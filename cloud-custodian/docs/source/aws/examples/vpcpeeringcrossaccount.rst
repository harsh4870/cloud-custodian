VPC - Notify On Invalid External Peering Connections
=====================================================

The following example policy will automatically create a CloudWatch Event Rule
triggered Lambda function in your account and region which will be triggered
anytime a new VPC Peering Connection is created.  The policy will then check
to see if the peering accepter account id and peering requester account id are both
AWS account numbers owned by you.  This is done by having the account ids from
the CloudWatch Event compared against a S3 hosted CSV of your AWS account numbers.
You must provide the CSV file of your account numbers or you can hardcode your account
numbers into the policy if you have a small static number of accounts.  The CSV would
look something like:
"271212121293","171717171716","27272727272724","121212112128","118118118118"

        When a new peering connection is created the Accepter and Requester account
        numbers are compared and if they aren't both internally owned accounts then the
        cloud and security teams are notified to investigate and delete the peering connection.

The following policy runs in pull mode and will scan all existing vpc peering connections
to see if any of them have external connections.  You will notice that the filters syntax
to pull the accepter and requester ids is slightly different between these 2 policies.
The first one pulls the information from the CloudTrail API event metadata and the second
policy uses information pulled back from a describe_vpc_peering_connections API call.
Using both policies allows you to check both new and existing peering connections.
