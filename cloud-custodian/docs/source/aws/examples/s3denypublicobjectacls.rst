S3 - Block Public S3 Object ACLs
=================================================

The following example policies will append a S3 bucket policy to every S3 bucket with
a policy statement called **DenyS3PublicObjectACL**  This will prevent any object
in these buckets from being set to public-read, public-read-write
,or authenticated-read (Any authenticated AWS user, not just local to account).
Being that S3 object permissions can be hard to track and restrict due to the huge
amount of S3 objects usually present in accounts, this policy allows you to prevent
the issue from occuring in the first place and helps maintain tighter S3 security
to avoid accidentally setting sensitive S3 objects to public.  Note the S3 bucket
policy has a NotPrincipal statement with several "AWS": arns.  These arns are owned
by AWS and they are used for the AWS logging services for Log Delivery Group, ELB Logs,
and Redshift Logs.  The ELB and Redshift arns are region specific
(sample includesus-east-1 and eu-west-1) so depending on the regions you are utilizing
you might need to add or remove addtional arns found here:
