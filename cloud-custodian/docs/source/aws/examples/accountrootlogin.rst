Account - Detect Root Logins
============================

The following example policy will automatically create a CloudWatch Event Rule
triggered Lambda function in your account and region which will be triggered
anytime the root user of the account logs in. Typically the root user of an AWS
account should never need to login after the initial account setup and root user
access should be very tightly controlled with hardware MFA and other controls
as root has full control of everything in the account. Having this visibility
to see if and when someone logs in as root is very important.

Note that the ``notify`` action requires the cloud custodian mailer tool to be installed.
