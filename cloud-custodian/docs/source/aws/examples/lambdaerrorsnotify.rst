Lambda - Notify On Lambda Errors 
=====================================================

The following example policy will run hourly as a CloudWatch Scheduled Event triggered Lambda function.
The policies filters will check each Lambdas CloudWatch Metrics for errors.  If there are any errors
in an hour period and the Lambda function is not tagged with **Custodian_Lambda_Error_Exclude**
then the policy will take the action of notifying the Lambda function owner and the cloud team.  These
notifications can help developers by informing them if unexpected errors occur so they can be quickly
addressed.

For the notify action in the policy to work you must have setup the c7n_mailer tool:
