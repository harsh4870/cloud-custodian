Tag Compliance Across Resources (EC2, ASG, ELB, S3, etc)
========================================================

Tag
  Tags instances matching filters with a 'c7n_status' tag by
  default and configurable value.

  Here's an example of renaming an extant tag

  .. code-block:: yaml

     policies:

       - name: ec2-tag-instances
         resource: ec2
         filters:
           - "tag:CostCenter": foobar
         actions:
           - type: tag
             key: CostCenter
             value: barrum


Report on Tag Compliance
  .. code-block:: yaml

     policies:

       - name: ec2-tag-compliance
         resource: ec2
         comment: |

               - "tag:CostCenter": absent
               - "tag:Project": absent


Enforce Tag Compliance
  All EC2 non-AutoScaling instances that do not have the three required tags (CostCenter, Owner, Project)
  will be stopped hourly after 2 days, and terminated after 5 days.

         Any instances which have previously been marked as
         non compliant with tag policies, that are now compliant
         should be unmarked as non-compliant.

Enforce Tag Compliance
  All AutoScaling Groups that do not have the 5 required tags:
  (Resource Contact, Billing Cost Center, Environment, Resource Purpose, Business Unit)
  will be suspended and stopped once after 24 hours and then hourly after 2 days, 
  and terminated after 3 days.  We are using a custom tag named c7n_tag_compliance

          Your ASG has been suspended and resized to 0 instances as they do not have all
          the required tags on them.  Please login to AWS and add the required tags to your ASG.
          Starting tomorrow hourly emails and suspensions will start occuring if the ASG is
          still not compliant. The following day your ASG will be deleted.
