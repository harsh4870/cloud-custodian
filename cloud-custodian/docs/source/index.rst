Cloud Custodian Documentation
=============================

Cloud Custodian is a tool that unifies the dozens of tools and scripts
most organizations use for managing their public cloud accounts into
one open source tool. It uses a stateless rules engine for policy
definition and enforcement, with metrics, structured outputs and
detailed reporting for clouds infrastructure. It integrates tightly
with serverless runtimes to provide real time remediation/response with
low operational overhead.

Organizations can use Custodian to manage their cloud environments by
ensuring compliance to security policies, tag policies, garbage
collection of unused resources, and cost management from a single
tool. 

Cloud Custodian can be bound to serverless event streams across multiple cloud providers that maps to security, operations, and governance use cases.
Custodian adheres to a compliance as code principle, so you can validate, dry-run, and review changes to your policies.

Cloud Custodian policies are expressed in YAML and include the following:

* The type of resource to run the policy against
* Filters to narrow down the set of resources
* Actions to take on the filtered set of resources

Navigate below to your cloud provider and get started with Cloud Custodian!
