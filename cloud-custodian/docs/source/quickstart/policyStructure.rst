Example tag compliance policy
=============================

In this sample policy we are filtering for EC2
instances that are: running, not part of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), not
already marked for an operation, have less than 10 tags, and are missing one or more
of the required tags. Once Custodian has filtered the list, it will
mark all EC2 instances that match the above criteria with a tag. That tag specifies an action
that will take place at a certain time. This policy is one of three that
are needed to manage tag compliance. The other two policies in this set are, 1)
checking to see if the tags have been corrected before the four day period
is up, and 2) performing the operation of stopping all instances
with the status to be stopped on that particular day.
