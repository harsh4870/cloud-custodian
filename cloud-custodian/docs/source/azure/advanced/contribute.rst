Developer Guide
===============

The c7n developer install includes c7n_azure.  A shortcut for creating a virtual env for development is available
in the makefile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make install
    $ source bin/activate

This creates a virtual env in your enlistment and installs all packages as editable.

You can also simply do `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install all dev/test dependencies.

Adding New Azure Resources
--------------------------

Install Azure Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custodian interfaces with ARM resources using Azure's SDKs.
Install the resources SDK in ``setup.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    install_requires=["azure-mgmt-authorization",
                      ...
                      "azure-mgmt-containerregistry",
                      ...

Create New Azure Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create your new Azure Resource.

- ``service``: The Azure SDK dependency added in step 1.
- ``client``: Client class name of the Azure Resource SDK of the resource you added.
- ``enum_spec``: Is a tuple of (enum_operation, list_operation, extra_args). The resource SDK client will have a list of operations this resource has.
    Place the name of the property as the enum_operation. Next, put `list` as the operations.
- ``default_report_fields``: Fields that are used for running ``custodian report``.

.. code-block:: python

    from c7n_azure.provider import resources
    from c7n_azure.resources.arm import ArmResourceManager


    @resources.register('containerregistry')
    class ContainerRegistry(ArmResourceManager):

        class resource_type(ArmResourceManager.resource_type):
            service = 'azure.mgmt.containerregistry'
            client = 'ContainerRegistryManagementClient'
            enum_spec = ('registries', 'list', None)
            default_report_fields = (
                'name',
                'location',
                'resourceGroup',
                'sku.name
            )


Load New Azure Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the required dependecies are installed and created the new Azure Resource, custodian will
load all registered resources. Import the resource in
``entry.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    import c7n_azure.resources.container_registry

Testing
-------

Tests for c7n_azure run automatically with other Custodian tests.  See :ref:`Testing for Developers <developer-tests>`
for information on how to run Tox.

If you'd like to run tests at the command line or in your IDE then reference `tox.ini` to see the required
environment variables and command lines for running `pytest`.


Test framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

c7n_azure uses `VCR.py` for tests.
This framework is used for tests in the official Azure Python SDK.

VCRpy documentation can be found here: `VCR.py documentation <https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

ARM templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure VCR cassettes can be easily re-recorded, there are ARM templates to deploy Azure tests infrastructure.

These templates will allow you to provision real Azure resources appropriate for recreating the VCR
cassettes used by the unit tests.  They will let you run the unit tests against real resources.

ARM templates and helper scripts can be found in `tools/c7n_azure/tests/templates` folder. 

There are two scripts `provision.sh` and `cleanup.sh` to provision and delete resources.

These scripts will provision or delete all ARM templates (`.json files`) in this directory using resource groups named
after the template files (`test_<filename>`).

This scripts use Azure CLI, so you need to `az login` and `az account set -s 'subscription name'` first.

You can optionally pass a list of file names without extension to the scripts to act only on those templates:

.. code-block:: bash

  provision.sh vm storage
  cleanup.sh storage

or do everything

.. code-block:: bash

  provision.sh

If test method requires real infrastructure, please decorate this method with the ARM template file name to ensure this test can automatically create 
required infrastructure if needed.

.. code-block:: python

    @arm_template('template.json')
    def test_template(self):

Cassettes
~~~~~~~~~

`AzureVCRBaseTest` attempts to automatically obscure keys and other secrets in cassettes and replace subscription ids,
but it is required to verify cassettes don't contain any sensitive information before submitting.

For long standing operations cassette can be modified to reduce test execution time (in case recorded cassette contains some responses with Retry-After headers or Azure SDK waits until resource is provisioned).

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use `tox` to run all tests or instead you can use `pytest` and run only Azure tests (or only specific set of tests). Runing recorded tests still requires some authentication, it is possible to use fake data for authorization token and subscription id.

.. code-block:: bash

  export AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN=fake_token
  export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=ea42f556-5106-4743-99b0-c129bfa71a47
  pytest tools/c7n_azure/tests
