Logging, Metrics and Output
===========================

Writing Custodian Logs to Azure App Insights
--------------------------------------------

Cloud Custodian can upload its logs to Application Insights. Each policyâ€™s log output contains the **policy name**,
**subscription id** and **execution id properties**. These logs will be found under the **trace** source in Application Insights.


Usage example using an instrumentation key:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s <output_directory> -l azure://<instrumentation_key_guid> policy.yml

Usage example using a resource name:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s <output_directory> -l azure://<resource_group_name>/<app_insights_name> policy.yml


Writing Custodian Metrics to Azure App Insights
-----------------------------------------------

By default, Cloud Custodian will upload the following metrics in all modes:

* **ResourceCount** - the number of resources that matched the set of filters
* **ActionTime** - the time to execute the actions.

In **pull** and **azure-periodic** mode, Cloud Custodian will also publish the following metric:

* **ResourceTime** - the time to query for and filter the resources,

Additionally, some custom filters and actions may generate their own metrics.
These metrics will be found under the **customMetrics** source in Application Insights.

Usage example using an instrumentation key:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s <output_directory> -m azure://<instrumentation_key_guid> policy.yml

Usage example using a resource name:

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s <output_directory> -m azure://<resource_group_name>/<app_insights_name> policy.yml

In **azure-periodic** and **azure-event-grid** modes, you can configure metrics under the **execution-options**.
As above, you can provide an instrumentation key or a resource name.


    .. code-block:: yaml

        policies:
          - name: periodic-mode-logging-metrics
            resource: azure.storage
            mode:
              type: azure-periodic
              schedule: '0 0 * * * *'
              provision-options:
                servicePlan:
                  name: cloud-custodian
                  location: eastus
                  resourceGroupName: cloud-custodian
              execution-options:
                metrics: azure://<instrumentation_key_guid>

.. _azure_bloboutput:

Writing Custodian Output to Azure Blob Storage
----------------------------------------------

You can pass the URL of a blob storage container as the output path to Custodian.
You must change the URL prefix from https to azure.

By default, Custodian will add the policy name and date as the prefix to the blob.

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s azure://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/logs mypolicy.yml

In addition, you can use `pyformat` syntax to format the output prefix.
This example is the same structure as the default one.

    .. code-block:: sh

        custodian run -s azure://mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/logs/{policy_name}/{now:%Y/%m/%d/%H/} mypolicy.yml

Use `{account_id}` for Subscription ID.


Authentication to Storage
-------------------------

The account working with storage will require `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on either the storage account
or a higher scope.
