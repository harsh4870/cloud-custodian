Hosting Options
---------------

The Azure provider for Cloud Custodian can be hosted by Azure Functions or in a containerized environment
like ACI or AKS. Both hosting options have periodic and event based execution modes.

For a quick and inexpensive start to running custodian policies, Azure Functions are a good hosting
strategy. The Azure Containter Host requires more up-front configuration, but can make running a 
large number of policies against multiple subscriptions more maintanable.
