Authentication & Access
=======================

Custodian supports four distinct authentication types, including Azure CLI integration, Service Principal,
MSI, and raw tokens.


Azure CLI
---------

If none of the following environment variables are set, Custodian will attempt to pull credentials and the default
subscription from Azure CLI.  This requires that you have already run :code:`az login` and selected your subscription in
Azure CLI.

Service Principal
-----------------

A Service Principal can be provided by setting the following environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

    AZURE_TENANT_ID
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

You can create a Service Principal with Azure CLI or via the Azure Portal.
The Service Principal requires the Contributor role to be assigned. 

Azure Portal
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow instructions to create and assign required permissions to the new Service Principal: 
`How to create Service Principal <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal>`_

Azure CLI
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    # select correct subscription
    az account set -s "my subscription name"

    # create Service Principal
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <name> --password <password>

This will yield something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "appId": appid,
      "displayName": name,
      "name": name,
      "password": password,
      "tenant": guid
    }

Map the Service Principal to environment variables for Custodian:

.. code-block:: bash

    AZURE_TENANT_ID=tenant
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=subscriptionId
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID=appId
    AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=password

The Service Principal already has Contributor role.

c7n-org
~~~~~~~

If you're using a Service Principal across subscriptions with `c7n-org`, you'll
need to grant it access to each of the subscriptions.

To grant access, see: 
`instructions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-the-application-to-a-role>`_

Access Token
------------

Passing access tokens directly is useful for integration or fake test authentication.

For fake test authentication, environment variables should be configured:

.. code-block:: bash

    AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN=fake_token
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=ea42f556-5106-4743-99b0-c129bfa71a47

You will also find this configuration in tox.ini.

Managed Service Identity
------------------------

For more information about MSI, see
`Azure Documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview>`_.

If `AZURE_USE_MSI` is set to any value, Custodian will attempt to use MSI.

If `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is not set, Custodian will use the System Identity.

If `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is set, Custodian will use the User Identity which matches the client id.

You must set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

.. code-block:: bash

    AZURE_USE_MSI=1
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=subscriptionId
    AZURE_CLIENT_ID=clientId

Azure Key Vault Integration
---------------------------

If you run Custodian inside Azure VM, AKS, ACI or Azure Functions, you can leverage Azure Key Vault to store
Service Principal credentials. You can store the json-formatted authentication file as a Key Vault secret.
It will be used to extend your local authentication options. Best practice is to configure **Subscription ID**
and **Tenant ID** locally and store the Service Principal credentials in Azure Key Vault.

Cloud Custodian leverages Managed Service Identity or User Assigned Identity to access Key Vault and retrieve
the extended configuration.

The following example shows the secret stored in a Key Vault:

.. code-block:: json

    {"client_id": "<your-sp-id>", "client_secret": "<your-sp-password>"}

To enable Key Vault integration support, populate ``AZURE_KEYVAULT_SECRET`` environment variable
with Secret Identifier. If you use User Assigned Identity, provide ``AZURE_KEYVAULT_CLIENT_ID`` with
your UAI Service Principal ID. 

.. code-block:: bash

    AZURE_KEYVAULT_SECRET=https://<vault_name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<secret_name>/<optional_secret_version>
    AZURE_KEYVAULT_CLIENT_ID=<UAI_SP_ID>

You can find more information on how to create Azure Key Vault Secrets in this
quickstart: `link <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal>`_.

Azure Storage access
--------------------

If your Service Principal will be writing logs to storage or leveraging queues
for mailer you should assign Storage roles, either at the subscription
level or resource group/storage account level.

Note: you cannot leverage Azure Storage functionality if you use Access Token for authentication.

- `Blob Data Contributor`
- `Queue Data Contributor`
