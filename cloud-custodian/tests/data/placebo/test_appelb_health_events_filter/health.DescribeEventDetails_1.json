The best practice is to keep at least eight IP addresses available in each subnet.\n\nThere are two ways to address the issue:\n- Configure the load balancers to use a different subnet in the same Availability Zone that has more free IP addresses.\n- Free up IP addresses in the current subnets by deleting unused ENIs or moving other resources to different subnets.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you address this issue to ensure that your load balancers are prepared to handle increases in traffic. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-manage-subnets.html.\n\nIf you require assistance to resolve this issue, contact us by opening a new support case at https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home."
